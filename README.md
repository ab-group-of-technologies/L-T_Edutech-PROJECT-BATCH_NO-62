Garbage Bin Level Prediction and Collection

Problem Description
➢Cities are exploring new ways to manage and treat municipal solid waste in order to
improve public health and the overall livability of urban areas.
➢ By using AI algorithms to predict, when garbage bins will need to be emptied, waste
collection vehicles can be operated more efficiently
➢ When garbage bins are full, collection services can be optimized to ensure that waste is
collected before it becomes a public health or sanitation issue
➢ The process of trash/garbage bin level prediction typically involves collecting data from
sensors or cameras installed on the garbage bins and using this data to train a machine
learning model
➢ The model can then be used to predict the fill level of a garbage bin based on its current
sensor readings or images
➢ AI-based trash bin level prediction can generate a large amount of data that can be used to
improve waste collection and management
➢ This is to ensure that waste is managed in an efficient, sustainable, and environmentally
friendly manner
➢ And also, this data can be used to optimize routes, plan for future waste management needs,
and identify areas where improvements can be made

Requirement Specification
➢ Use the trash bin levels dataset (dataset attached) with different features like date, time,bin level, Bin ID, week no, fill level (in liters), total(liters), fill percentage, location, 
latitude,longitude, temperature (in ⁰c) and battery level
➢ Develop appropriate ML models for predicting filled status of the bin level binary
classifications such true /false for different areas and localities

Judging Metrics
➢ Trash bin Level Classification -Precision, Recall, Accuracy, F1-score and confusion matrix
